    travel_guide: "March-June is an ideal time to visit to experience a lot of activities truly. Seasoned visitors who want to experience the beauty of different weathers can choose to do so. Roads are largely well maintained throughout the year. Although, it might be difficult to cross past Barsheni in the winter months.\n\nSummer months provide great weather of around 15 degrees and thus, which is bliss, especially compared to the scorching Indian Summer! While it has started getting very crowded during this period, you’ll experience minimal tourist activity in Tosh.\n\nWhile summer is when the prime-time activities might be taking place (read: rave parties, lots of treks, a bunch of travelers chilling in cafes), you might be wise to choose the post-monsoon period for tranquillity and solace."
